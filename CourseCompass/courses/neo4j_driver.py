"""
Neo4j Database Connection Script
--------------------------------
This script connects to the Neo4j Aura database using the official Neo4j Python driver.
This contanins the graph of the various courses and their prerequisites.
It bypasses SSL certificate verification (use with caution in production) to handle 
self-signed certificates or local development environments.

Functionality:
1. Defines database connection credentials.
2. Configures an SSL context to skip certificate validation.
3. Establishes a connection to the Neo4j instance.
4. Verifies the connection.
5. Runs a simple test query to confirm connectivity.
